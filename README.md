# Employee-database
### Welcome to my employee database application!

* This application is designed to help you manage your company's employees. You can use the login and register functions to securely access the dashboard, where you can view, edit, and delete your departments and users.

* One of the key features of this application is the employee filter, which allows you to easily filter employees by department. This can be especially helpful when you need to quickly find information about a specific group of employees.

> This application was created as a **school project**. It is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and efficient. I hope you find it helpful and easy to use!

> You are welcome to contribute to the development of this application. Whether you have suggestions for new features, bug reports, or code contributions, we value your input and appreciate any help in improving the application.
